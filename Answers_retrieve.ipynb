Note however that save for very few credit cards the vast majority will charge you a conversion fee on each transaction around 2 5 . Using a debit card and taking out money at an ATM when needed is another alternative although you again may be limited by the ATM network . There are also fees but usually not as dire as the dedicated exchanges. You may also find that banks that are off the tourist traps will give better exchange rates. From my experience when traveling in a first world country you are safe taking about 20 in cash for incidentals filling in the rest with debit withdrawals and credit cards as available. Be sure to call your credit card company and your bank before you leave and let them know your dates of travel. It will save you uncomfortable moments in front of an ATM or in a restaurant when your transaction is denied. Finally be aware of your debit card daily and one time withdrawal limits. Because of the fees you may well want to withdraw up to the max and if your max is too low and if you can only withdraw up to that max once a day your access to cash may be restricted. When you are calling your bank also inquire about these limits and see if you can have them raised if necessary.

I usually carry with me enough money to pay for everything I need on the first 3 days. The rest of my money I try to get with my credit cards and I usually try to carry two of them. Always try to pay for hotel car and other similar before you start your trip. In this case at least you will be able to sleep the first night.

This was an issue for me in some places in France back in 2004 when I could not buy some last minute souvenirs. I also try to not get money back from the country.
