Note however that save for very few credit cards the vast majority will charge you a conversion fee on each transaction around 2 5 . Using a debit card and taking out money at an ATM when needed is another alternative although you again may be limited by the ATM network . There are also fees but usually not as dire as the dedicated exchanges. You may also find that banks that are off the tourist traps will give better exchange rates. From my experience when traveling in a first world country you are safe taking about 20 in cash for incidentals filling in the rest with debit withdrawals and credit cards as available. Be sure to call your credit card company and your bank before you leave and let them know your dates of travel. It will save you uncomfortable moments in front of an ATM or in a restaurant when your transaction is denied. Finally be aware of your debit card daily and one time withdrawal limits. Because of the fees you may well want to withdraw up to the max and if your max is too low and if you can only withdraw up to that max once a day your access to cash may be restricted. When you are calling your bank also inquire about these limits and see if you can have them raised if necessary.

I\\'m travelling from western Canada. 1 Would it be a good idea from a timeline point of view? Or will it be too rushed? 2 I did some preliminary research regarding airfare and it looks like almost all flights from Peru to Brazil will have to be from Lima more time wasted travelling back and forth and also one way tickets are extremely overpriced strong sometimes even double the price of return tickets. Is it possible to obtain better prices for travel from Peru to Brazil? 3 How does the amazon experience in Peru compare to in Brazil? Is one better ?

But... Peru has plenty to offer. You\\'re probably flying into Lima but not one person I\\'ve ever spoken to who has been to Lima has said it was a city worth visiting. Because of that I skipped it on my trip this year though I am stopping by next year . Distances in Peru and South America are huge. You\\'ll lose a lot of time moving from major Peruvian site to major Peruvian site. Adding Brazil to your itinerary will only give you less time to actually see and do things. Yes Rio is very much worth a visit but as you found out flying between Peru and Brazil is prohibitively expensive. If you want to get to Brazil on the cheap you can take a bus via Cusco to Puerto Maldonado from where you can get to Rio Branco which is just across the border in Brazil. From Rio Branco you can get budget airlines to Rio or any other Brazilian destination of your choice. But this is a time consuming process. Yes the Amazon experience in Peru yes you can visit the Amazon in Peru too is decidedly different and not necessarily worse from what you can get in Brazil. But to get to the Brazilian Amazon from Peru either will cost you plenty of time overland or money flying a complex route to get to Manaus most likely . My advice would be that if you can set aside 20 days spend them in Peru and perhaps Ecuador. Or if you really want some diversity take overland transport to Bolivia. \"],\"username\":[\"MastaBaba\"]},{\"subtitle\":[\"One can visit the Iguazu Falls a on two sides the Brazilian and the Argentinian side.

Unless you have lots of reales to spend on airfare or you already have flights scheduled I would recommend booking bus fares ASAP. You kinda have to balance the expense of the flight versus how far away your destination is and compare that to the bus fare and time on bus to make a decision as to what\\'s best for you.
